# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Boston-Housing-Data
Found significant differences in median values for houses near Charles River. Discovered correlations between Nitric oxide levels and non-retail business areas. Highlighted impact of distance to employment centers on median home values. Valuable insights gained for real-world data understanding.

In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis on a dataset containing information about Boston housing. The dataset was obtained from a reliable source and includes various features related to housing attributes in different neighborhoods of Boston.
Objectives:
1.	Data Loading and Preprocessing: I started by loading the dataset using the Pandas library in Python. The dataset contained information about various features such as crime rate, zoning, proportion of non-retail business acres, etc. I performed data preprocessing steps to ensure the dataset was clean and ready for analysis.
2.	Descriptive Statistics: I generated descriptive statistics to gain initial insights into the dataset. This included calculating measures like mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles for different attributes.
3.	Data Visualization: I created various visualizations to better understand the data. These visualizations included box plots, bar plots, scatter plots, and histograms. Each visualization was accompanied by appropriate labels and titles for clear interpretation.
4.	Hypothesis Testing: I conducted several hypothesis tests to answer specific questions about the dataset:
-	I performed an independent samples t-test to determine whether there is a significant difference in the median values of houses bounded by the Charles River compared to those not bounded.
-	An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to investigate whether there is a difference in median values of houses for different proportions of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
-	I used Pearson correlation to determine the relationship between Nitric oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
-	A regression analysis was conducted to understand the impact of an additional weighted distance to Boston employment centers on the median value of owner-occupied homes.
Findings:
The t-test results indicated a significant difference in median values of houses based on whether they were bounded by the Charles River.
The ANOVA results suggested that there is no significant difference in median values of houses across different age groups of owner-occupied units.
The Pearson correlation analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between Nitric oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
The regression analysis showed that an additional weighted distance to Boston employment centers had a significant impact on the median value of owner-occupied homes.
Conclusion:
Through exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing, I gained valuable insights into the Boston housing dataset. These insights shed light on relationships, differences, and impacts within the dataset's variables. The project highlights the importance of data analysis and visualization in understanding complex real-world datasets and drawing meaningful conclusions from them.
